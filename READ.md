Robot hand and LED control via a web camera that views a person's hand to identify the state of each finger, either up or down.  Image data is processed using Windows11 and a Python script including Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries. The Python script is: "multi_finger_8_25_to_pico_servo.py". It must use the Python 3.12 interpreter  in order to use the Mediapipe library. The Python script sends an array of 5 integers specifying the state of each of the fingers (up or down) to Raspberry Pi Pico via the Pico serial port (USB COM). The line” pico = serial.Serial('COM3', 115200) “ must be set to the actual COM port values that the Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to on the user’s computer. 
A Micropython script uses the Thonny IDE to control 5 servo motors on a Raspberry Pi Pico and 5 LEDs. The Pico receives finger state data via its serial port, a Windows USB COM port.  The Micropython script is "main.py” and it must be saved via Thonny in the Pico internal flash memory. Then the Thonny IDE "configure interpreter" setting must be switched from the COM port  to local Python to free up the serial port while the Pico board is still connected to USB port. Then the Pico board must be unplugged from the USB and then reconnected to be without a connection to Thonny.
