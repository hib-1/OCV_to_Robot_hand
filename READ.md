Using Windows11: A web camera views a person's hand to control a robot hand's fingers via Raspberry Pi Pico, using Mediapipe and  OpenCV Python libraries. Python code for OpenCV and mediapipe: multi_finger_8_25_to_pico_servo.py
Must use python 3.12 in order to use mediapipe library. Most code was generated by Microsoft Copilot. 
Thonny micropython IDE is used to control servo motors on a Raspberry Pi Pico via USB Com port. Micropython script for Raspberry Pi Pico: pico_servo_rcv_from_ocv_reversed.py 
Must save Pico Micropython script as main.py on the Pico internal flash memory. Then switch Thonny to local Python to free up serial communications while pico board is still connected. Then disconnect pico board from USB and reconnect it.
